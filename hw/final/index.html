                        <p class="text1">Growing up in a private aeronautical community where my house was a block from a private airstrip made me want to become a pilot at a young age. I had always had an interest in aviation as my mother was a flight
                              attendant for almost 20 years which allowed me to fly on planes almost every month. Fast forward five years during the summer of 2019, I had a lot of time on my hands which made me want to start my flight training.</p>

                        <h5 class="title2">Getting my Certificate</h5>
                        <p class="text2">My instructor recommended that I fly atleast once a week to stay proficient to prevent my flying from getting rusty, and to maximize my learning skills. The more you fly, the better you become as a pilot. I did my best to
                              adhere to his direction and I ended uo flying atleast 3 times a week.I was so excited to fly evertime and my Certified Flight Instructor made sure to switch things up every flight so that it would never get boring. Selecting a CFI that you
                              vibe and connect with is super important because this person will be with you for the duration of your training. You want to pick someone that you know you will get along with. If there is no chemistry, you will be miserable. The training
                              included
                              basic fundamentals, cross country flying, night flying, and a ton a ground school to learn everything that is necessary to fly safely in the National Airspace System. I got to fly all over the South Florida Region and got to see some
                              beautiful scenery Florida has to offer. Thankfully, the weather during my training was perfect which made the flying much more reasonable.

                              During the beggining stages of your training, you are required to "Solo" which is when the instructor signs you off to go gly by yourself. This was an exhillaterting feeling because I was the only soul on board and everything was up to me.
                              My CFI got out of the plane and said "Have fun!". I was surprised at how simple the transition from supervised to unsupervised flight was. I taxied down to the runway, said a few encouraging words to myself, and did what I was taught for
                              the
                              previous 10 or so flight hours of training. As I pulled the yoke back and lifted off, I gave myself a big "Let's go!". Here is a picture of the Solo Tradition of getting the back of your shirt cut off after your first successful solo

                        <p class="text3">The next few months of training were all in preparation for my FAA checkride. Leading up to the checkride I was busy with my studies at UM and the FAA examiner was going to be out of town for a while.
