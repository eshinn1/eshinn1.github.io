                              <p class="grid-text">Growing up in a private aeronautical community where my house was a block from a private airstrip made me want to become a pilot at a young age. I had always had an interest in aviation as my mother was a flight
                                    attendant for almost 20 years which allowed me to fly on planes almost every month. Fast forward five years during the summer of 2019, I had a lot of time on my hands which made me want to start my flight training.</p>

                              <p class="grid-text">My instructor recommended that I fly atleast once a week to stay proficient to prevent my flying from getting rusty, and to maximize my learning skills. The more you fly, the better you become as a pilot. I did my best
                                    to
                                    adhere to his direction and I ended uo flying atleast 3 times a week.I was so excited to fly evertime and my Certified Flight Instructor made sure to switch things up every flight so that it would never get boring. Selecting a CFI that
                                    you
                                    vibe and connect with is super important because this person will be with you for the duration of your training. You want to pick someone that you know you will get along with. If there is no chemistry, you will be miserable. The training
                                    included
                                    basic fundamentals, cross country flying, night flying, and a ton a ground school to learn everything that is necessary to fly safely in the National Airspace System. I got to fly all over the South Florida Region and got to see some
                                    beautiful scenery Florida has to offer. Thankfully, the weather during my training was perfect which made the flying much more reasonable.
                                    During the begining stages of your training, you are required to "Solo" which is when the instructor signs you off to go gly by yourself. This was an exhillaterting feeling because I was the only soul on board and everything was up to me.
                                    My CFI got out of the plane and said "Have fun!". I was surprised at how simple the transition from supervised to unsupervised flight was. I taxied down to the runway, said a few encouraging words to myself, and did what I was taught for
                                    the
                                    previous 10 or so flight hours of training. As I pulled the yoke back and lifted off, I gave myself a big "Let's go!". Here is a picture of the Solo Tradition of getting the back of your shirt cut off after your first successful solo
                                    flight.

                              <p class="grid-text">The next few months of training were all in preparation for my FAA checkride. Leading up to the checkride I was busy with my studies at UM and the FAA examiner was going to be out of town for a while. The last 20 hours
                                    of
                                    your training is entirely focused on emergency checklists, maneuvers, and anything a pilot may need to brush up on before the big test. The private pilot checkride consists of a roughly 3 hour oral test and then a 2 hour flight with the
                                    FAA
                                    examiner. The oral test was a smooth sailing for me simply because I overpreapred by study an etensive amount on weather, aerodynamics, weather, flight calculations, and just about everything you need to know in order to be a <b>safe</b>
                                    pilot. My examiner was a great guy who did everything he could to make me feel relaxed from the minute I walked into his office. I knew it was not going to be easy but I could tell that he wanted it to be as fair as possible. Everything
                                    about my checkride went amazingly well. He would ask me a question and I knew every answer by textbook definition.Then we went up into my Cessna 172 and began the practical portion. We went over everything I was taught and expected to
                                    know;
                                    slow flight, stalls, steep turns, turns around a point, VOR navigation, different types of landings, etc. My examiner mentioned in the beggining of the flight that I would know if I passed or failed by the time we landed. During the
                                    flight
                                    my maneuvers were on point and it was my best flying to this day. We landed back in Stuart and my examiner shook my hand and said I was a newly rated Private Pilot!</p>
