                                                      Africa has many activties and sights to offer but my favorite thing that I did was probably staying at a safari that was practically in the middle of nowhere. We only had wifi for 1 hour a day which is extremely rare given what we
                                                      are used to back home, LOL!

                                                <p>
                                                      This Kenyan safari was steep in price. My family roughly paid around $5,000 per person. That included meals, wifi, all safari activties, night walks, spa and airfare to Capetown.

                                                <p>
                                                      I visited Bali back on 2017 and although it was some time ago, I had the best time of my life. You can get a real bang for your buck as a United States Citizen because of how strong the exchange rate is. Bali has many fun areas
                                                      including Ubud, Uluwatu, Kuta, and Seminyak. Ubud is known for their beautiful rice paddies and lush foliage. My favorite spot was Uluwatu which is a fun surf spot for locals and it is not too touristy for my liking!
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                      Avid world travelers like to rave about how cheap Bali is when in reality GETTING there is whats expensive. Airfare can range from $2,000 to $5,000 roundtrip in economy. Make sure to check Google Flights for the best fare!

                                                      Given that Texas is a U.S state, flights are cheaper than if you were to travel outside of the country.

                                                      My favorite country in the world-- Japan. I have been to Japan 5 times over the course of my lifetime and I can't express how much love I have for this country. From the friendly people who will help you with anything you may need,
                                                      to the amazing fresh seafood at Tsukiji Fish Market -- Japan has it all. I stayed in a neighrbrhood called Odaiba wich is a 10 minute subway ride to all of the hot spots. Make sure to get yourself some cheap ramen at a vending
                                                      machine (Yes, vending machine ramen!).

                                                      Japan is no cheap country to visit, including air fare. Make sure to avoid traveling there during the cherry blossom season which is February to April.

                                                      I believe Beijing is suitable for a weeklong visit. Spend a few days exploring the hutongs, and take a journey to the Great Wall, Forbidden City, and Summer Palace. That should almost be enough to occupy your time. You should feel
                                                      somewhat safe as a visitor. For a kid from a small Midwestern town, it might be horribly crowded, but if you handle it correctly, everything will be OK. Have fun and stay off the subway during rush hour!

                                                      Similiar to Japan, Airfare can be quite expensive to get to China but once you're there, Hotels are on the cheaper end.

                                                      Iceland offers scenery like never seen before. You really feel like you are in a movie at all times. From the natural lagoons to the jaw-dropping Skogafoss waterfall, oppurtunities are endless. One thing I was suprised about were
                                                      the people. I read many articles online that the people would be friendly but that was not the case with me. I try to smile at everyone I make eye contact with and be resepctful of local culture but that was not helpful.

                                                      enjoy it properly. The entire journey from Ollantaytambo to Aguas Calientes by train, bus, then walking up to the gates of Machu Picchu to take in the iconic view. Do it if you get the chance to see it.

                                                      Flights to South America can be cheaper if you fly out of Miami International Airport since it is a big latin american hub.

                                                      Eat everything in sight. I advise visiting a little Bavarian town. There isn't much to see that's exciting in most major cities throughout the world. There are museums and large structures, but those things aren't all that

                                                      Germany, like most of Europe, can be expensive but it depends where you go. If you visit an urban city, your wallet will be emptied a lot quicker than if you go to a rural town.
